# NativeBase Legacy 

A scandal has happen and NativeBase decided to remove important and essential componets. But have no fear, NativeBase Legacy is here. 

This repo contains the missing and deprecated components from [NativeBase](https://github.com/GeekyAnts/NativeBase)

# Installation

It's easy:

```
yarn add native-base-legacy
```

# How to use it

That's even easier. Instead of importing from `native-base` just import from `native-base-legacy`:

```
import {Drawer} from 'native-base-legacy'
```

Everything else stays the same!

# Components

Currently the only component in here is the Drawer as it was removed in merge request 2100.
